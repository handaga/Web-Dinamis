## What is jQuery?

jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library created by John Resig in 2006 with a nice motto − Write less, do more.
jQuery simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development.
jQuery is a JavaScript toolkit designed to simplify various tasks by writing less code. Here is the list of important core features supported by jQuery −

* **DOM manipulation** − The jQuery made it easy to select DOM elements, traverse them and modifying their content by using cross-browser open source selector engine called Sizzle.
* **Event handling** − The jQuery offers an elegant way to capture a wide variety of events, such as a user clicking on a link, without the need to clutter the HTML code itself with event handlers.

* **Animations** − The jQuery comes with plenty of built-in animation effects which you can use in your websites.
* **Lightweight** − The jQuery is very lightweight library - about 19KB in size ( Minified and gzipped ).
* **Cross Browser Support** − The jQuery has cross-browser support, and works well in IE 6.0+, FF 2.0+, Safari 3.0+, Chrome and Opera 9.0+
* **Latest Technology** − The jQuery supports CSS3 selectors and basic XPath syntax.
